## Features

- **Menu bar icon**: Shows mic status (🎤 active / 🎤🚫 muted)
- **Global hotkey**: `⌘⇧M` (Cmd+Shift+M) to toggle mute from anywhere
- **All microphones**: Mutes built-in, USB, and external mics (including Sennheiser Profile, webcams, etc.)
- **System-level**: Works as an override for video calls (Google Meet, Teams, Zoom)

## Usage

### Run directly:
```bash
swift build -c release
.build/release/MacMicMute
```

### Run as app bundle:
```bash
open "Mac Mic Mute.app"
```

### Install to Applications:
```bash
cp -r "Mac Mic Mute.app" /Applications/
```

## Permissions

The app may require **Accessibility** permissions for global hotkey support:
- System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility
- Add the app to the list

## Building

```bash
swift build -c release
```

## How it works

Uses CoreAudio APIs to:
1. Enumerate all audio input devices
2. Toggle hardware mute if supported
3. Fall back to setting volume to 0 for devices without hardware mute

The app runs as a menu bar-only app (no dock icon) with `LSUIElement` set to true.
